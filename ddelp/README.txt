What makes our application useful:
It's a easy, quick way for Dukies to rate dishes on campus and discover new ones. Although it is similar to Yelp, it is specific to Duke dishes. Additionally, it is much easier to "review" a dish; users simply must up or downvote dishes. This convenience incentivizes Dukies to use our app.


Special instructions needed to set up, run, access, or use your application (like user passwords you have set up, command line utilities, or external programs that need to be run):

References for your data that establishes its authenticity:
We and our user testers manually inputted data based on our real experiences with Duke Dining.


Discuss both the pros and the cons of different framework possibilities you considered and why you made the decision you did (including choosing not to use any framework):
We initially thought to use React since it is supposedly widely used in the industry. However, through our explore project, we realized that we were much more familiar with Vue, and weren't comfortable building such a large project with a framework we just learned. Thus, we used Vue at the end, since it was the easiest for us to use.
However, through building our app, we realized some cons of Vue. For example, many online resources describe how to use previous versions of Vue, such as when trying to retrieve data from Firebase in descending order. Also, propogated data between components in Vue was static, so we had to work around that.
